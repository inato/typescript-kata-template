## Do

- Mars rover kata
- TCR
- a fast VSCode!

## Learn

- baby steps
- TCR is an exercise to learn more than a practical technique for BAU
- small and focused tests
- interesting to go from rover to position in baby steps
- learning to use the tools is important

## Puzzle

- TDD is more practical
- Is there a TDD tool to encourage you to do baby steps?
  - continuous runner?
- How is it applicable?
  - reuse baby steps techniques
  - learn how much you can do without error
- How to apply these techniques when test setup is complicated?
- Our VSCode has become very slow
  - Is it Typescript?
  - Should we split the codebase?

## Decide

- think of more ways to work in baby steps
